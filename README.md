# Train-data-app
Javascript course, project 2

This project is made by Lauri Kara.

The application is for getting train data from Digitraffic and displaying it in a table in a usable form for seeing train departure times by station in the HSL area.

Self-evaluation:

<ul><li>The project is published on Github and deployed to Netlify.</li>
<li>Everything is commented in the code
<li>External libraries are not used
<li>CSS is used to style the page, and it's responsive to screen size
<li>No hard coded onclick -listeners.
<li>Project is done individually
</ul>
<ul><li>The User can select a trainstation and get current timetable info regarding that station
<li>The page is made easy to use and well readable while not looking too plain
<li>All of the HSL area stations are available for finding data
<li>However, there's no custom search string
    </ul>

All of the written requirements are met. The application works as intended with no noticeable errors, and could really be used for travel if needed.
    
I would give this project 25/30 points.
