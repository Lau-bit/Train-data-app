# Train-data-app
Javascript course, project 2

This project is made by Lauri Kara.

The application is for getting train data from Digitraffic and displaying it in a table in a usable form for seeing train departure times by station in the HSL area.

Self-evaluation:

>The project is published on Github and deployed to Netlify.
>Everything is commented in the code
>External libraries are not used
>CSS is used to style the page, and it's responsive to screen size
>No hard coded onclick -listeners.
>Project is done individually

>User can select a trainstation and get current timetable info regarding that station
>The page is made easy to use and well readable while not looking too plain
>All of the HSL area stations are available for finding data
>However, there's no custom search string

The application really works and could really be used for travel if needed.
    
I would give this project 25/30 points.
